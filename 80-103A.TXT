****** 80-103A TERMINAL PROGRAM ******


THE FILE "80-103A.ASM" IS A SPECIAL VERSION OF THE MM100.ASM
TERMINAL PROGRAM.  IT IS THE SAME EXCEPT FOR THE 50 MS TIME
DELAY ROUTINE.  THE MM100 PROGRAM USES THE 50 MS TIMER ON THE
MICROMODEM 100 BOARD.  THE 80-103A PROGRAM USES SOFTWARE TO
CREATE THIS DELAY.  THIS MEANS THAT THIS DELAY WILL DEPEND ON
THE SPEED OF THE PROCESSOR.  IT IS CURRENTLY SET FOR A 2 MHZ
8080.  IF YOU RUN THIS PROGRAM ON A DIFFERENT SPEED CPU YOU
WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE "MHZ   EQU   2" STATEMENT ON THE FIRST
PAGE OF THE LISTING TO MATCH THE SPEED OF THE CPU.  FOR A
4 MHZ CPU THE LINE SHOULD READ  "MHZ    EQU    4".

NOTE:  THE PROGRAM "REMOTE.ASM" WILL HAVE TO BE MODIFIED TO
       RUN WITH THE 80-103A BY CHANGING THE TIME DELAY ROUTINE
       TO WORK WITHOUT THE MICROMODEM 100 HARDWARE 50 MS TIMER.
       THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATING THIS PROGRAM ARE CONTAINED
       IN THE LISTING.
